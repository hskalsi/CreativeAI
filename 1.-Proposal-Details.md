## Proposal Overview

The purpose of the proposal is to demonstrate that you've thought about and planned how you will finish your project. Your proposals will also let us know how we can help you.

## Proposal Format

Your proposal submission should be named:

```
proposal.pdf
```

Here are the items that must be contained in your proposal:

1. Team Name

    - Team Name
    - group member 1; uniqname 1
    - group member 2; uniqname 2
    - group member 3; uniqname 3
    - group member 4; uniqname 4

2. Work distribution plan for the core

3. Work distribution plan for the reach

4. The two reach sections you intend to complete (one Visual and one Data)

5. Where and when you plan to meet

## Sample Proposal

- Team Name: Creative AI Staff

- John Lennon; jlennon

- Paul McCartney; mccartney

- George Harrison; hairygeorge

- Ringo Starr; ringstar

- For the core, John and Paul plan to work on implementing the functions in nGramModel.py, while George and Ringo plan on implementing the functions in unigramModel.py, bigramModel.py, and trigramModel.py. We will then get together to implement the core functions in generate.py, and we will all test our functions together to make sure we all understand the different parts of the project.

- For the reach, we will implement Harmonic Sounds (Data) and use matplotlib to graph the songs we've created (Visual). Instead of using songs from the Beatles, we intend to use songs from Taylor Swift, perhaps the greatest international artist of all time, maybe all history.

- We plan to meet in the UgLi basement on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2AM to 6AM, with each of us also working on the project on our own.
