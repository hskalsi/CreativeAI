## Proposal Overview

The purpose of the proposal is to demonstrate that you've thought about, and planned, how you will go about doing the core and reach. Your proposals will also let us know how we can help you better.

## Proposal Format

*Note that if you choose to use datasets other than the lyrics/music provided in the starter code, you will need to get approval from us first. This is because this project works better with larger datasets, which means that artists with fewer songs may not be a good choice. Also, we do not permit the use of songs with explicit lyrics.*

Your proposal submission should be named:

```

Here are the items that must be contained in your proposal:

- Team Name

- group member 1; uniqname 1

- group member 2; uniqname 2

- group member 3; uniqname 3

- group member 4; uniqname 4

- work distribution plan for the core

- choice of artist for lyrics (optional - only if you don't want to use the provided Beatles lyrics)

- work distribution plan for the reach

- choice of music in the form of MIDI files, and where you will obtain that music (optional - only if you don't want to use the provided Nintendo Gamecube music. Note that we wrote a program to automatically get you music for any video game platform you'd like, but if you choose to get your MIDI files from elsewhere, you will need to talk to a staff member for specific instructions because there is some data preprocessing involved)

- your ideas for how you will make your final product unique (see reach section for suggestions). Note that you're not bound to what you put in the proposal; if you come up with new or better ideas after you submit your proposal, talk to a staff member.

- where and when you plan to meet

## Sample Proposal

- Team Name: Creative AI Staff

- Tara Safavi; tsafavi

- Amir Kamil; akamil

- Madeline Endres; endremad

- Erin Donahue; erindon

- For the core, Tara and Amir plan to work on implementing the functions in nGramModel.py, while Maddy and Erin plan on implementing the functions in unigramModel.py, bigramModel.py, and trigramModel.py. We will then get together to implement the core functions in generate.py, and we will all test our functions together to make sure we all understand the different parts of the project.

- Instead of using the lyrics of the Beatles, we would like to use the lyrics of Taylor Swift, which works because she does not have explicit lyrics and she has almost 200 songs.

- For the reach, Tara and Maddy will work on the getNextNote and trainMusicModels functions. Amir and Erin will work on the generateMusicalSentence function. We will get together to write runMusicGenerator, and we will all test together.

- We will use the provided Nintendo Gamecube music data.

- Our idea for making our reach product unique is to make songs with different sections in different keys, and then randomly generate titles for our songs. However, we think that this idea may change if we get a better/more cohesive idea while working on the reach.

- We plan to meet in the Ugli basement on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2PM to 6PM, as well as each of us working on the project on our own.
