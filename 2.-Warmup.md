## Warmup Overview

For the warmup, you will implement several short functions that manipulate Python dictionaries and lists. The purpose of this exercise is to get you familiar with the Python constructs that will be used for the rest of the project. 

## Warmup Structure

```warmUp.py```: implement each function in this file. This is the only file that you need to edit for the warmup. The warmup file is contained in the ```warmup``` directory. To test your functions, run the file; you can do this from terminal with this invocation:

```python warmUp.py```

The Warmup uses something python calls ```doctests``` -- the test case for each function is built into each function's documentation. For instance:

```
def add(a, b):
"""This function returns the sum of a and b.
>>> add(2, 3)
5
>>> add(0, -1)
-1
"""
return a + b

```main()``` thus looks like this:

```
import doctest
doctest.testmod()
```

The ```doctest``` module will then see the test cases in ```add()``` and run them. If ```add(2, 3)``` does not evaluate to ```5```, doctest will report an error. All you need to do is invoke ```python warmUp.py```.

Though the warmup does count toward your final project score, we will not run any tests on it beyond the doctests we've given you. If you pass those doctests, you will get full points on the warmup. We will grade the warmUp.py in your GitHub repository. This means that only one member of your group needs to complete it -- but **everyone in your group should be capable of completing it**. The concepts you will need to solve these problems are required for the core and the reach.
