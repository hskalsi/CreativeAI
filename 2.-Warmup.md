## Warmup Overview

For the warmup, you will implement several short functions that manipulate Python dictionaries and lists. The purpose of this exercise is to get you familiar with the Python constructs that will be used for the rest of the project. 

## Warmup Structure

```warmUp.py```: implement each function in this file. This is the only file that you need to edit for the warmup. The warmup file is contained in the ```warmup``` directory. To test your functions, run the file; the output will let you know whether you have passed all the test cases provided.

Though the warmup does count toward your final project score, we do not run any tests on it beyond what ```warmUp.py``` will run. This means that once you pass it, you will get full points for the exercise, so you can put the warmup aside and focus on completing the main project.

You only need to have one completed warmup for your entire group, but **everyone in your group should be capable of completing it**. The concepts you will need to solve these problems will be very applicable for the core and reach.
