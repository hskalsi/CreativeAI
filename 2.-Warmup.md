## Warmup Overview

For the warmup, you will implement several short functions that manipulate Python dictionaries and lists. The purpose of this exercise is to get you familiar with the Python constructs that will be used for the rest of the project. 

## Warmup Structure

There are three files in the ```warmup/``` directory:

1. ```warmUp.py```: implement each function in this file. This is the only file that you need to edit for the warmup.
2. ```runTests.py```: this file is your "personal autograder" with infinite submits - run it as a Python program to test your solutions to the functions in ```warmUp.py```. If you fail any test cases, this program will stop and tell you the test case input and expected output for the first function you failed, so you have an idea of what's going wrong in your implementation. Once you can run this file and pass all of our test cases, you are done with the warmup. You do not need to modify this file at all.
3. ```tester.pyc```: this (the 'c' stands for 'compiled') is the actual testing code ```runTests.py``` uses. We have only given you the compiled Python so you cannot see the correct implementations of the warmup functions. You do not need to look at this file, open it in PyCharm, or touch it in any way - it will just look like a bunch of nonsense to you because it's compiled. Just make sure to leave it in the ```warmup/``` directory.

Though the warmup does count toward your final project score, we do not run any tests on it beyond what ```runTests.py``` will run. This means that once you pass it, you will get full points for the exercise, so you can put the warmup aside and focus on completing the main project.

You only need to have one completed warmup for your entire group, but we highly recommend that everyone in your group is capable of completing it. The concepts you will need to solve these problems will be very applicable for the core and reach.
