## Showcase

Be sure to bring headphones for the showcase, since it will be loud and you will want to show your music output to others. If your group doesn't have headphones, consult a staff member. If you can, bring over-the-ear headphones instead of earbuds, since many people will be using the headphones throughout the course of the day.

Beyond headphones, you can choose how you want to present your lyrics and music to others. In our demos we used music visualization software and created videos; you could do the same, or make playlists of your generated songs for users to browse, or print out your lyrics and put them on a poster, or so on. However, your group *must also bring a laptop* to the showcase so you can demo your project's lyric and music generation in real time. Every member of your group is expected to contribute to your demo and give technical explanations of how the project was implemented, what concepts you learned, how you chose to do the reach, etc.

## Extra Credit

If your group goes "above and beyond" in some way, we will award you up to 10 points of extra credit. We will not define "above and beyond" for you - just find some way to show that you're passionate about, and involved with, this project, and you will likely be rewarded.
