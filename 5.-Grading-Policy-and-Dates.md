We will be auto-grading the core, but we will hand-grade the reach. Note that the more difficult or long functions in the core will be worth more of your core grade. Be sure to maintain good coding style throughout; your project will eventually be read by humans and graded by hand.

Please include a document called ```README.md``` in the root directory of your project that specifies how to run your project. Unless specified otherwise in your ```README.md``` we will run your code with the following invocation from the command line: ```python generate.py``` Otherwise ***we will not change your code or add files to your repository in order to grade your code.*** We will add extra python packages specified in your ```README.md```, but otherwise your code must run on our machine without modifications. If any part of your project doesn't run without modifications your score on that part will be 0.

## Showcase

Be sure to bring headphones for the showcase, since it will be loud and you will want to show your music output to others. If your group doesn't have headphones, consult a staff member. If you can, bring over-the-ear headphones instead of earbuds, since many people will be using the headphones throughout the course of the day.

Beyond headphones, and the required Visual Component (see Reach section) you can choose how you want to present your lyrics and music to others. If you want, you can just bring your laptop and run the program as a demo to others. However, you are certainly allowed and encouraged to be more creative. Here's a non-exhaustive list of ideas:

- You could make playlists of your generated songs for users to browse.

- You could print out your lyrics and put them on a poster.

- You could try to make an animated "lyric video" in the style of lyric videos on Youtube, which could incorporate both music and lyrics. 

- Similar to the idea above, you could make a sort of "karaoke video".

- If anyone in your group plays an instrument that would be okay to bring to the showcase, and if you can think of a way to incorporate your instrument into your demo, that would be fine. 

No matter what your group chooses, though, you **must also bring a laptop** to the showcase so you can demo your project's lyric and music generation in real time. Every member of your group is expected to contribute equally to your demo and give technical explanations of how the project was implemented, what concepts you learned, how you chose to do the reach, and so on. Your showcase presentation will count for part of your grade.

Otherwise, enjoy the showcase and good luck on the Final Project!
