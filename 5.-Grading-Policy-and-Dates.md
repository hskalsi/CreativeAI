We will be auto-grading all of the required functions for the warmup, core, and reach, but we will hand-grade the "unique" part of the reach. Note that the more difficult or long functions in the core/reach will be worth more points of your core/reach grades, respectively. Also, be sure to maintain good coding style throughout, since part of your project will be read by humans and graded by hand.

###Please note that we will not change your code or add files to your repository in order to grade your code. We will add extra packages you used in your project, but otherwise, your code must run without modifications. If any part of your project doesn't run without modifications your score on that part will be 0.

## Showcase

Be sure to bring headphones for the showcase, since it will be loud and you will want to show your music output to others. If your group doesn't have headphones, consult a staff member. If you can, bring over-the-ear headphones instead of earbuds, since many people will be using the headphones throughout the course of the day.

Beyond headphones, you can choose how you want to present your lyrics and music to others. If you want, you can just bring your laptop and run the program as a demo to others. However, you are certainly allowed and encouraged to be more creative. Here's a non-exhaustive list of ideas:

- In our demos we used iTunes music visualization software and created videos; you could do the same.

- You could make playlists of your generated songs for users to browse.

- You could print out your lyrics and put them on a poster.

- You could try to make an animated "lyric video" in the style of lyric videos on Youtube, which could incorporate both music and lyrics. 

- Similar to the idea above, you could make a sort of "karaoke video".

- If anyone in your group plays an instrument that would be okay to bring to the showcase, and if you can think of a way to incorporate your instrument into your demo, that would be fine. 

No matter what your group chooses, though, you **must also bring a laptop** to the showcase so you can demo your project's lyric and music generation in real time. Every member of your group is expected to contribute to your demo and give technical explanations of how the project was implemented, what concepts you learned, how you chose to do the reach, etc.
