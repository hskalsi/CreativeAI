## Showcase

Be sure to bring headphones for the showcase, since it will be loud and you will want to show your music output to others. If your group doesn't have headphones, consult a staff member. If you can, bring over-the-ear headphones instead of earbuds, since many people will be using the headphones throughout the course of the day.

Beyond headphones, you can choose how you want to present your lyrics and music to others. If you want, you can just bring your laptop and run the program as a demo to others. However, you are certainly allowed and encouraged to be more creative (which might result in extra credit as well!) Here's a non-exhaustive list of ideas:

- In our demos we used iTunes music visualization software and created videos; you could do the same.

- You could make playlists of your generated songs for users to browse.

- You could print out your lyrics and put them on a poster.

- You could try to make an animated "lyric video" in the style of lyric videos on Youtube, which could incorporate both music and lyrics. 

- Similar to the idea above, you could make a sort of "karaoke video".

- If anyone in your group plays an instrument that would be okay to bring to the showcase, and if you can think of a way to incorporate your instrument into your demo, that would be fine. 

No matter what your group chooses, though, you **must also bring a laptop** to the showcase so you can demo your project's lyric and music generation in real time. Every member of your group is expected to contribute to your demo and give technical explanations of how the project was implemented, what concepts you learned, how you chose to do the reach, etc.

## Extra Credit

If your group goes "above and beyond" in some way, we will award you up to 10 points of extra credit. We will not define "above and beyond" for you - just find some way to show that you're passionate about, and involved with, this project, and you will likely be rewarded.
