Now that you've implemented the core, you can build from it to create more interesting projects. You now have a project that generates music and lyrics based on an artist's repertoire. You will build on that core to both create better models and new ways of showing your models.

The Reach, then, has two components: a Visual component and a data component. You are expected to complete one of each.

## Visual Component

### (Something Performance related FIXME)

(???)

### Data Visualization

## Data Component

(matplotlib)

### Grammatical Lyrics

(nltk)

### Musical Harmony

(Pentatonic Scale)

However, this is now your project. There is no autograder. We want you to be creative with your final project and shape your reach in a way that's interesting to *you*. These reach options are guidelines, with no formal set of instructions. You must pick from each option, but these options are guidelines only. With that in mind, you may use any tools or libraries you like on your project.
