# Overview

Now that you've implemented the core, you can build from it to create more interesting projects. You now have a project that generates music and lyrics based on an artist's repertoire. You will build on that core to both create better models and new ways of showing your models.

The Reach, then, has two components: a Visual Component and a Data Component. **You must complete one Visual Reach and one Data Reach.** We have provided four options, but how you implement them is entirely up to your interests. There is no autograder for the Reach --  we will grade everything by hand. So feel free to explore ideas that interest you and shape your project the way you want to shape it. With that in mind, you may use any tools or external libraries you would like. Outside tools are allowed and encouraged. As long as you complete one Visual Component and one Data Component, your Reach may use any other tools you would like.

# Visual Component

You must complete one of the following Visual Components. The language models you have built are very powerful, but right now they just produce text and midi files. We want you to use one of these reaches to visualize your projects so that users can *see* the data you've produced.

## Twitterbot

## Data Visualization

**matplotlib**

# Data Component

You must complete one of the following Data Components. These will extend your models so that the data you produce begins to sound like real music or real song lyrics. 

## Grammatical Lyrics

**nltk**

## Musical Harmony

**pysynth**

# Submission

We will grade the last submission to your GitHub team repository before the project deadline. We will ***NOT*** grade earlier submissions, revert to an early commit, or make any changes to your project. We will run your project exactly as they are submitted. If you forget to push changes to your repository before the deadline we will not grade them. 

Please include a file named `README.md` root directory of your repository. The `README.md` file must include a summary of what your reach does and instructions on how to run your program. If your project uses additional external libraries you must specify them here so we know to download them. If your project only runs on Windows or Mac, please let us know so we will grade it on the proper machine. Except for external libraries, if your code does not run when we pull your repository, you will get a 0. See the Grading section for more info.

Remember, this is now your project. There is no autograder. We want you to be creative with your final project and shape your reach in a way that's interesting to *you*. You must pick one Data and one Visual option, but these options are guidelines only.
